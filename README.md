# pokitdok-clojure

A small PokitDok API client

## Usage

```clj

(require '[com.pokitdok.client :as pokitdok])

;; Make a client
(def c (pokitdok/create-client CLIENT-ID CLIENT-SECRET))

;; Grab an oauth token
(pokitdok/connect! c)

;; Make a specific request
(pokitdok/get-activity c "42")

;; Or make a custom request using clj-http param maps
(pokitdok/request c {:method :get
                     :url "/activities 42"})
```

`com.pokitdok.client` contains functions that implement the v4 PokitDok API.

## Extension points

com.pokitdok.impl/HTTPClient is available to piggyback your own HTTP library.
By default, clj-http is used.
